          <h3 class="title">YOU FOUND ME - The Fray</h3>
          <p class="lyrics">
            I found God<br>
            On the corner of First and Amistad<br>
            Where the west<br>
            Was all but won<br>
            All alone<br>
            Smoking his last cigarette<br>
            I said, "Where you been?"<br>
            He said, "Ask anything"<br>
            Where were you<br>
            When everything was falling apart?<br>
            All my days<br>
            Were spent by a telephone<br>
            That never rang<br>
            And all I needed was a call<br>
            That never came<br>
            To the corner of First and Amistad<br><br>
  
            [Chorus]<br>
            Lost and insecure<br>
            You found me, you found me<br>
            Lying on the floor<br>
            Surrounded, surrounded<br>
            Why'd you have to wait?<br>
            Where were you? Where were you?<br>
            Just a little late<br>
            You found me, you found me<br><br>
  
            [Verse 2]<br>
            In the end<br>
            Everyone ends up alone<br>
            Losing her<br>
            The only one who's ever known<br>
            Who I am<br>
            Who I'm not, and who I wanna be<br>
            No way to know<br>
            How long she will be next to me<br><br>
          </p>
          <p class="lyrics">
            [Chorus]<br>
            Lost and insecure<br>
            You found me, you found me<br>
            Lying on the floor<br>
            Surrounded, surrounded<br>
            Why'd you have to wait?<br>
            Where were you? Where were you?<br>
            Just a little late<br>
            You found me, you found me<br><br>
  
            [Bridge]<br>
            For early morning<br>
            The city breaks<br>
            And I've been calling<br>
            For years and years and years and years<br>
            And you never left me no messages<br>
            You never send me no letters<br>
            You got some kind of nerve<br>
            Taking all I want<br><br>
  
            [Chorus]<br>
            Lost and insecure<br>
            You found me, you found me<br>
            Lying on the floor<br>
            Where were you? Where were you?<br>
            Lost and insecure<br>
            You found me, you found me<br>
            Lying on the floor<br>
            Surrounded, surrounded<br>
            Why'd you have to wait?<br>
            Where were you? Where were you?<br>
            Just a little late<br>
            You found me, you found me<br><br>
  
            [Outro]<br>
            Why'd you have to wait<br>
            To find me? To find me?<br>
